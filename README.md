# Xylophone Mobile AppðŸŽ¹

## The Goal

In this tutorial I will be diving into more Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this module, I should be comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.


## What I will create

I'm going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.

## What I will learn

- How to incorporate open source libraries of code into your project using Flutter Packages.
- How to play sound on both iOS and Android.
- How to generate repeated user interface Widgets.
- How to use Dart functions that can take input arguments as well as return an output.
